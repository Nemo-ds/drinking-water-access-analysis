# Drinking Water Access Analysis (Google Sheets)

📊 A data exploration project on the evolution of global access to drinking water services using WASH (UNICEF/WHO) data from 2012 to 2022.

## 🌍 Project Objectives

- Explore access to different types of drinking water services (safely managed, basic, limited, unimproved, surface water)
- Analyze disparities between regions and between rural/urban areas
- Focus on Sub-Saharan Africa due to its low access rates
- Visualize trends and inequalities using Google Sheets tools

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- Google Sheets (pivot tables, conditional formatting, charts, data cleaning)
- Datasets: WASH (WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme)
- Charts: line charts, stacked bar charts, bubble charts

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Global and regional trends (2012–2022)
- Rural vs. Urban comparisons
- Evolution of safely managed water access
- Population without acceptable services (limited + unimproved + surface water)
- Conditional formatting by service level
